The x,y goal coordinates that had been previously randomly generated between [-10,10) were now generated in separate regions for training and eval.
The [-10,10] region was divided using a checkerboard pattern, where the length of each tile was speciffied as the parameter delta. Even tiles were
used for training and odd ones were used for testing. For delta in {3,5,10}, no significant performance difference was observed between training and
testing for the recurrent model, which indicates that the algorithm generalizes well even to tasks that were not seen during training (although they are
still similar to training tasks).
