Due to the high variance of the runs, the parameters that could keep an average (over 4 experiments) of rewards over 700 for the
last 10 iterations were considered to converge to 1000. The highest lr + lowest bs that achieved this were (0.01, 200). In the plot,
it is possible to see that the average gets to 1000 on the last few iterations. However, due to the high variance of the data,
some runs fall below 1000 in the last 10 iterations.
